# NSU-BankMate

Welcome to NSU BankMate is a unique Java-based bank management tool that was deliberately designed with NSU students in mind. Recognizing the financial issues that students encounter, this app offers a variety of features that provide an all-encompassing banking solution.

The interactive dashboard at the core of NSU BankMate provides students with a picture of their financial situation, from tuition fees to housing rates to cafeteria spending. 
Its integrated transaction history allows students to easily track their spending and deposits. Students may use a dedicated savings planner to help them pay for academic materials, activities, and unplanned costs. 
From paying university dues to settling accounts with campus suppliers, the bill payment function simplifies operations.
